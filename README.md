# Pomodoro Clock

**_HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React_**

- As a key project for my freeCodeCamp ceritification, this project highlights the ability to develop code to pass prebuilt tests. The JavaScript logic means that this is a fully functioning Pomodoro Clock.
- The Calculator was built using customized CSS and a HTML structure written in JSX for the React App.
